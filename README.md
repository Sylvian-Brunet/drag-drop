## HTML CSS JS Drag & Drop for a input file

Hello everyone, here is one of my last projects on which I work during my free time.  
A simple drag and drop input file with preview.  
I know that this kind of project already exists, but I wanted to make mine in native Javascript.  
This project is RTU (ready to use), just copy files and past them on your directory.  
Of course, this project is modifiable according to your wishes, especially on the CSS.  
For information, the part about allowed file extensions is purely visual, all added files are present in the input file. So I leave it to you to sort out the files in the processing of your form.  

Don't hesitate to suggest modifications if you notice errors, or possible improvements.
